Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.\n\nThis submission will eventually become your Introduction/Business Problem section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your Introduction/Business Problem section only for now) to your Github repository and submit a link to it."

For example, someone would want a park close and someone would prefer a market close. So how can we find a place according to our preferences? In this report, we try to solve this problem with a data science approach."
